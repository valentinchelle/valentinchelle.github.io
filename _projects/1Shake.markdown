I founded the company Shake.ai, that aims to develop AI experiences ran entirely on mobile devices. Our first product is an iOS app that helps you learn you dances by analyzing your body during the dance and comparing your move with the model dance.

Anyone can import new dances in less than a minute, and every computation is done locally on the mobile device.

Quick demo of our AI:
